      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        I build websites and program computers. 
        I spend most of my time hopping around multiple webpages for work. 
        If your work is web-based, you might agree that it can be difficult staying productive when you’re busy juggling tabs and webpages.
        Have you ever felt like there wasn’t enough space on your screen, or like you needed more screens to efficently work? 
        Does navigating your virtual workspace wear you out more than doing your actual work? 
        There are programs that make things like editing photos, or doing taxes super simple by organizing 
        everything you need, all in one place. My website offers that kind of organization and simplicity to 
        your web-based workspace; giving you access to everything you need without the headache of trying to 
        fit, juggle, and resize multiple windows of content into the four corners of your screen, no matter the task.
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
         My audience consists of those who use web-based applications for work, who are seeking a higher level of productivity/efficiency 
         while working, or for anyone who would like to better organize their web-based workspace. This would include professionals in 
         web-development, students (especially online-only students), or anyone who finds their power to uniquely organize their personal 
         browsing experience lacking. Whether the project is for school, for work, or something personal, the audience for this site is for 
         who are looking for a better way to get things done.

Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: [Roboto Mono(Bold Italic)]  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        The Roboto font family is used all over the web. The characters are easily discernable, and prolonged reading of this font is easy on the eyes.
        This is optimal for a workspace enviroment and it promotes the overall objective/purpose of the site.<br/>
        
    <br/>The Heading is Roboto Mono: Bold and Italic. This is a good contrast to the text body or paragraph font. 
        <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: [Roboto Condensed (Regular)]  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
          The paragraph body is composed of Roboto: regular. This is a very readable text that does not disctract and does not strain the eyes during prolonged
          work sessions.<!-- change this -->

         If your work is web-based, you might agree that it can be difficult staying productive when you’re busy juggling tabs and webpages. 
        Have you ever felt like there wasn’t enough space on your screen, or like you needed more screens to efficently work? Does navigating 
        your virtual workspace wear you out more than doing your actual work? This website offers you the kind of organization and simplicity necessary to 
        take your work-flow to the next level. We give you access to everything you need without the headache of trying to fit, juggle, and resize multiple 
        windows of content into the four corners of your screen, no matter the task.<br/><br/>
        If you are a professional in web-development, a student, or anyone who finds their power to uniquely organize 
        their personal browsing experience lacking, this is the site for you. Whether the project is for school, for work, or something personal, this site is 
        for those looking for a better way to get things done.<br/><br/>
        This site is still under-construction, so what you are seeing now is Phase One: The launch site.<br/><br/>
        Does this look like you?<br/><br/>If your workstation setup looks something like this, you've probably grown
        accustomed to having a high level of customization, efficiency, and freedom in how you work. Trying to take care of all that one one screen while
        away from you dedicated setup can become frustrating, to say the least.<br/><br/>
        With tools that free up your screen to only what you want displayed makes a world of difference. With smart tools that not only let you customize what is visible, but also 
        how those elements look (i.e. shape, size, formatting) and how they function: minimize, maximize, simplify, all on-the-fly to make the most out of the limit real estate that 
        your screen affords. No need to fumble with bookmark bars, simply import your bookmarks from your web browser and gain full access without uneccesary obstruction. We are working on the same sort of control for managment of
        your tabs, web-search functionality, mailbox access, as well as text editors with IDE functionality, and more!<br/><br/>
        Its not about how much screen you have, it's about how you use what is there. Like using fullscreen mode, but with all the portals you want to see simultaneously there together, and in whatever configuration, without unecessary frames
        bars, etc. cluttering the content you specifically want to use and see.

      <h3>[About Us]</h3>
      <p>
        This is us! I program, I code, I do just about all of my work on a computer, and the majority of that work is done in a browser. The frustrations that come 
        from being an online student, from working within a browser day after day, led to me creating this site.<br/><br/>
        I wanted a better way to coordinate all of the different pages, tabs, and tasks that I found myself juggling on a daily basis. Trying to organize my screen 
        became more exhausting than the actual work (especially since most of my work was done on a laptop, without many opportunities to utilize more than one screen).<br/><br/>
        The sole purpose of this website is to help people who may struggle the same as I did so that they can become more efficient and productive in their work.<br/><br/>
