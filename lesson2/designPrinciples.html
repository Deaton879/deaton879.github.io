                alt="image of FamilySearch.com home page to showcase principle of alignment">
                <p>The landing page of familysearch.org demonstrates great use of the principle of <b>alignment</b>. 
                    Starting with the background image which centers on the boy holding a picture, continued through 
                    the center aligned text which starts at the center of the page, there is uniformity throughout.</p>

                <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
                <h3>Nintendo Life</h3>
                <div><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/">nintendolife.com</a></div>

                alt="image of NintendoLife.com home page to showcase principle of Visual Hierarchy">
                <p><b>Visual hierarchy</b>emphasizes where you should be focusing your attention, and Nintendo Life 
                demonstrates a great case of utilizing that design element here.
                The most important elements and features are highlighted by the visual emphasis placed on them. For instance, 
                it is easy to see where the featured or highlighted articles are by the size of the picture, and then the next 
                thing you notice visually is the picture for the first article in the latest news section. These are the key 
                features that they want your focus to be on.</p>

                <h2>White Space</h2>
                <h3>Random-ize</h3>
                <div><a href="https://www.random-ize.com/">random-ize.com</a></div>
                <img class="designElementPic" src="../images/WhitespaceCleanDesign.JPG" 
                alt="image of random-ize.com home page to showcase effective whitespace and clean design">
                <p>The Random-ize page is a great example of effectively utilizing <b>white space</b> to create a clean and 
                simple design, without looking like basic html. This page still looks professional with the other elements used,
                and the simplicity and uncluttered view makes for a nice browsing experience.</p>
